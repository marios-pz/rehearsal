 * Puts five demo ads on the board, or takes them off again.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT part of bootstrap.js. A fresh database starts empty on
 * purpose: an empty board is honest, a board of fake bands is not. This is
 * for looking at the thing while developing, so it has to be run by hand
 * and every band it creates says "(Demo)" in its name.
 *
 * Ads die after 14 days, so re-run this whenever the board has gone quiet.
 * It is idempotent: the public_ids are fixed, so a second run refreshes the
 * same five rows rather than piling up new ones.
 *
 *   node scripts/seed-demo.js            seed, or refresh for another 14 days
 *   node scripts/seed-demo.js --remove   delete them
